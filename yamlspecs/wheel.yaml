  description: |
     This library is the reference implementation of the Python wheel packaging standard, as defined in PEP 427.
     It has two different roles.
       1. A setuptools extension for building wheels that provides the bdist_wheel setuptools command
       2. A command line tool for working with wheel files
     Wheel is not intended to be used as a library, and as such there is no stable, public API
