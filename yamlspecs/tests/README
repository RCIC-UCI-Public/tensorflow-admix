The files in this directory are for testing installed RPMs
for compied tensorflow. 

To run any file do:
    module load python/<version>
    python FILENAME

Note 1: classify-image.py depends on _tkinter and needs DISPLAY set
to show the images. use ssh with -X -Y flag to enable  Xforwarding.
Host must have xorg-x11-xauth RPM installed.

Note 2: for classify-images.py, in non-interactive mode, displays all 
figures and block until the figures have been closed.  This is a default 
matplotlib.pyplot.show() behavior. If overwrite is as show(block=False)
the blocking stops but the images flash and close.
