The files in this directory are for testing installed RPMs
for compied tensorflow. 

To run any file do:
    module load python/<version>
    python FILENAME

Note 1: classify-image.py depends on _tkinter and needs DISPLAY set
to show the images. use ssh with -X -Y flag to enable  Xforwarding.
Host must have xorg-x11-xauth RPM installed.

Note 2: for classify-images.py, in non-interactive mode, displays all 
figures and block until the figures have been closed.  This is a default 
matplotlib.pyplot.show() behavior. If overwrite is as show(block=False)
the blocking stops but the images flash and close. 


Command line checks
===================
python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.__version__)"
python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"


Check for numpy version (hex)
============================
from numpy.core import setup_common
hex(setup_common.C_API_VERSION)
