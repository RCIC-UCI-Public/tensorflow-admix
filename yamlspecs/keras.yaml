  description: |
    Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on
    top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.  Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that 
      - allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility)
      - supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as their combinations 
      - runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU
  build:
    pkgmake: echo 'Build performed in install'
  install:
    makeinstall: !ifeq "{{type}},setup,{{install_setup}},{{install_pip}}"
  requires:
    - python_{{pyversion}}
    - python_{{pyversion}}-pyyaml
