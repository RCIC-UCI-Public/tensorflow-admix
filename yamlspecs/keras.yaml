    Deep learning for humans
    Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.
    Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that 
      - Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility)
      - Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two
      - Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU
  requires:
    - python_{{ pyversion }}
    - python_{{ pyversion }}-PyYAML
